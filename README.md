HTML5 game of the famous puzzle game

## About

This game is already published on newgrounds:
http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/618974

It is actually more of a 'sandbox' at the moment than a full game.

It makes use of the sheetengine library:
http://sheetengine.codeplex.com/ <br>
Since it makes use of this library, this project falls under the same licences of this library.

## Idea

Feel free to use, copy or alter this code in any way you want.
When major changes are published, I'll publish this game again with a 'social-coding' label.
